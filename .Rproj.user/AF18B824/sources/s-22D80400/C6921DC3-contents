title: "Video Interviewing: A Best Practices Discussion"
description: |
  There is a rich body of literature in I-O Psychology that helps outline best practices when creating selection measures in organizations (e.g., Campion et al., 1997; Huffcutt & Arthur, 1994; Morgeson & Campion, 1997; Sackett & Lievens, 2008). Some of these best practices include structured and standardized approaches in the way questions are asked and scored. These guidelines are, to some degree, easier to follow when interviews occur in person because the environment can be heavily controlled by the organization. However, in the current climate, more organizations are opting in to utilizing video interviews which should not be regarded as comparable to in person interviews. The current panel discussion addressed the research and practice gap that exists with more novel methods. This panel was discussed at the 2021 SIOP conference.

Recently, technology has advanced the ways in which organizations can conduct selection interviews. A 2015 survey performed by Futurestep, a Korn Ferry company, found that 71% of the seven-hundred executives they surveyed use video-interviewing at their organization (Futurestep, 2015). Given the increase in technology-integrated workplaces over the past decade and the rapid move to remotely delivered selection processes due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we can likely assume that these numbers have greatly increased. There are a number of video interview benefits that have fueled this increased adoption, such as the reduced costs in the form of travel expenses and time it takes to individually interview applicants, increased flexibility for both applicants and organizations, expanded applicant pools, increased efficiency, and interview standardization (Blacksmith et al., 2016; Brenner et al., 2016; Langer et al., 2017). With over 100 online vendors offering access to their video interview solutions (Software Advice, 2020) organizations are faced with the decision to conduct either two-way or one-way video interviews.

The difference between one-way and two-way interviews exists in the synchronicity of the interview experience. Two-way video interviews, also known as synchronous video interviews, are a form of communication in which applicants and evaluators communicate via a video conference (Straus et al., 2001). Applicants and evaluators see and hear one another in real-time through a videoconference platform (Langer et al., 2017). One-way interviews, also known as asynchronous video interviews, allow applicants to record their answers to interview questions and submit them via an online platform (Gorman et al., 2018). A one-way video interview process typically involves a web link that is sent to prospective applicants inviting them to an online platform to complete the interview (Torres & Gregory, 2018).  Once the invitation is accepted, applicants are prompted to record their responses to predetermined interview questions on camera and submit those responses via the online platform (Brenner et al., 2016).  The recorded responses are reviewed later at the convenience of an evaluator, be that a hiring manager, recruiter, or artificial intelligence (Woods et al., 2019). Although interchangeable as current methods of applicant interviews between organizations, there are remarkable differences between two-way and one-way interviews that can influence both the candidates’ experience and the usefulness of the interview.

## Establishing Best Practices

First, several differences between in-person and video interviews need to be addressed when considering best practices for video interview procedures. The two most critical factors to consider when making the comparisons among existing methods are fairness and information. Fairness considerations include: (a) determining whether interviewees are each getting the same amount of time to answer questions, or whether time accommodations are given to specific people that need extra time, (b) whether interviews are viewed in their entirety by evaluators, and (c) how scoring is conducted (e.g., human or AI). In contrast, information considerations focus on how information is lost and gained, and include: (a) what do we learn about an applicant, or organization, when we come face-to-face with them versus when we see them on video, (b) what information is gained from an applicant conducting a video interview from their home environment, and (c) what information is lost by restricting interview communication to video or recorded responses? Below, we briefly review video interviews in comparison to face-to-face interviews as well as provide a comparison of both video interview formats on these dimensions.
	
## Video Interviews vs. Face-to-Face
	
Traditionally, interviews are thought of as a face-to-face interaction between an interviewer and interviewee (Campion et al., 1997). Thus, it is valuable to discuss fairness and available information during video interviews as they compare to face-to-face interviews because face-to-face interviews are used as an anchor. When we compare fairness between these types of interviews, it is important to consider the extent to which they adhere to the 15 core components of good structured interviews (Campion et al., 1997), which include: (1) time spent interviewing, (2) time spent scoring, (3) types of scoring procedures and how they may differ, and (4) differences in impression management potential. In addition, from an information perspective, we can think about what is lost and gained in both settings. It is important to note that the information that is gained in a video interview setting may be non-KSAO related (e.g., posters on an interviewee’s wall; dogs barking in background), which links obtaining information directly to considerations around fairness. Ultimately, the information lost in video interviews may be in the form of lower media richness in video interviews (e.g., non-verbal behaviors, eye-contact).  However, increased structure in video interviews may lead to greater job relevant information gained from the interview experience.

## One-Way vs. Two-Way Video Interviews 

Using this same fairness-information framework, we can compare one-way and two-way video interviews. From a fairness perspective, we can consider: (1) time allotted for interviewing/answering questions, (2) time spent reviewing and scoring (3) applicant reactions to both mediums, (4) influences on organizational attraction, (5) influences on evaluator ratings, and (6) applicant performance between mediums. From an information perspective, we can consider: (1) information gained from follow-up questions and interactivity in two-way interviews, (2) information lost from a lack of interpersonal communication available in one-way interviews, and (3) information gained in the form of increased structure one-way interviews.
	
Both of the dimensions discussed are critical to consider from applicant and evaluator perspectives. Thoughtfully considering the dimensions when creating selection assessments from both of these lenses can lead to a more well-rounded approach to organizational decision making in their selection process. The chair and co-chairs of the session have carefully collected the panelists to discuss some of these issues.

## Fairness
1.	In terms of designing, scoring, and communicating with applicants, what do you see as best practice when delivering a one-way and two-way interview?
a.	Potential follow-up: In asynchronous interviews, if questions are not provided beforehand, should there be preparation time allotted before interviewees are to record their response?
