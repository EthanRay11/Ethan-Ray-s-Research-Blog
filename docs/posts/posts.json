    "contents": "\n\nTalent management involves the deliberate effort by an organization to manage the supply, demand, and flow of talent (Lewis & Heckman, 2006). When placing talent in an organization there are many considerations, one of the most important being person-environment fit. Person-environment (PE) fit, defined as the compatibility between an individual and their work environment, is vital to performance in the organization (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005). In fact, PE fit has been referred to as, “so pervasive as to be one of, if not the dominant conceptual forces in the field” (Schneider, 2001, p. 142).\nThere are multiple types of PE fit. Some of the core constructs being person-vocation, person-group, and person-supervisor fit (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005). In this paper we will be specifically focusing on person-job (PJ) and person-organization fit. Both PJ and PO fit are important aspects the employment relationship, as good PJ and PO fit have been linked to positive work outcomes such as job performance, retention, and job satisfaction (Caldwell & O’Reilly, 1990; Resick et al., 2007). Additionally, poor PJ and PO fit result in negative work outcomes. However, there is a lack of understanding as to personal and situational characteristics that moderate fit-outcome relationships (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005). It is imperative to address this research gap in order to fully understand how to best facilitate employee job and organizational fit within a talent management system.\nThis paper will cover the existing literature on the topic and identify potential moderators of these relationships. Next, we will discuss the current gap between practice and research while identifying any strategic ways to approach PJ and PO fit for organizations. Finally, a proposal will be outlined to research the proposed moderators of these relationships in a study population.\nDefining Person-Environment Fit\nPJ and PO fit are closely related subsets of PE fit. PJ fit is the compatibility between a person’s characteristics and those of the job or tasks required to complete the job (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005). There exist two theoretical conceptualizations of PJ fit. First, PJ fit may be conceptualized as an employee’s knowledge, skills, and abilities being commensurate with what is required to complete the job. This is known as demands-abilities fit. Second, PJ fit may be conceptualized within a needs-supplies framework. This is the amount that an employee’s needs, desires, or preferences are met by the jobs they need to perform.\nPO fit, simply put, is the compatibility between people and the entire organization (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005). At least one of these entities provides what the other needs. This relationship can also be categorized in a demands-abilities or needs-supplies fit framework. A key component of PO fit is that an individual and the organization share similar, fundamental characteristics if there is to be sufficient fit (Resick et al., 2007). For example, individuals will be most successful in organizations that share their personalities (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005).\nThere is a litany of outcomes of fit in jobs and organizations, both positive and negative. Positive PJ fit outcomes include increased job performance, increased job satisfaction, and job retention (Caldwell & O’Reilly, 1990; Kristof-Brown et al., 2005). Positive PO fit outcomes are increased job performance, increased job satisfaction, organizational retention, and organizational commitment (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005; Resick et al., 2007). Negative PJ fit outcomes include an increased intent to quit and psychological strain (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005). Finally, negative PO fit outcomes include poor coworker satisfaction and poor trust in managers (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005). Outcomes between the two types of fit overlap a great deal. There are a variety of important outcomes, however research lacks on personal and situational characteristics that moderate these fit-outcome relationships.\nThere exists insufficient research on fit-outcome moderators. Current research suggests that fit is most influential if the dimensions measured are important to the individual (Edwards, 1996). The limited research that exists has been split into two camps, personal and situational moderators. The personal characteristics that have been analyzed are self-esteem and various personality traits. The situational characteristics have been researched even less with the only two being relationships with managers and coworkers, and job performance (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005). Situational moderators are particularly important to practice because many managers face the challenge of minimizing the effects of poor fit for their employees. With such limited research on fit-outcome moderators there is an imperative to further understand what characteristics influence this relationship.\nIdentifying Key Moderators\nIn order to identify and hypothesize additional moderators of the PJ/PO fit-outcome relationship I will be taking a needs-supplies fit perspective. I will also be assessing job performance as the outcome of the fit-outcome relationship as job performance is an important goal of talent management. The three moderators I will be assessing will be role overload, passive leadership, and approach-avoidance temperament. These variables were chosen as key moderators of the fit-outcome relationship because they are important situational and personal moderators and are theoretically likely to influence the relationship.\nRole overload, a situational characteristic, exists when people believe that the demands placed on them cannot be fulfilled in the available time or that they lack the skills for satisfactory task performance (Barling & Frone, 2017). The inability to fulfil work demands goes against employee desires in the needs-supplies model. By actively overwhelming an employee’s role, the supplies they gain from their job or organization are rapidly diminished. Additionally, this moderating effect is likely to be more impactful for PJ fit than PO fit. Role overload is a job-centric construct and is less likely to influence the PO fit to job performance relationship (Barling & Frone, 2017). For these reasons, the following are hypothesized:\nH1: Role overload moderates the relationship between PJ/PO fit and job performance, such that the positive relationship is weaker for individuals high in role overload.\nH2: Role overload moderation will be more influential on PJ fit to job performance relationship.\nPassive leadership, another situational characteristic, is defined as leaders failing to initiate structure in the workplace or define tasks for their subordinates. Additionally, this leadership style is generally ineffective because when problems do not exist or are not directly apparent to the leader, they do not engage with their employees (Kelloway et al., 2005). The reduced support from a leader will detract from an employee’s needs. A reduction in an employee’s needs being met will reduce the positive relationship between fit and job performance due to less needs-supplies fit. Additionally, this moderating effect should be more impactful for PO fit than PJ fit. Leaders have more of an influence on how employees interact with an organization than their job in particular. Thus, the following are hypothesized:\nH3: Passive leadership moderates the relationship between PJ/PO fit and job performance, such that the positive relationship is weaker for individuals high in passive leadership.\nH4: Passive leadership moderation will be more influential on PO fit to job performance relationship.\nApproach-avoidance temperament, a personality characteristic, is a behavioral trait as to how individuals are motivated by events. Approach behavior is instigated or directed by a positive or desirable event while avoidance behavior is instigated or directed by a negative or undesirable event (Elliot & Thrash, 2002). Focusing on approach temperament, the positive event from sufficient PJ/PO fit will further motivate employees to increase their fit in their job or organization and subsequently positively influence job performance. Theoretically, this moderating characteristic should be more impactful for PJ than PO fit. This is because an individual who is motivated can have more of an impact on their job since it is directly accessible to them. For these reasons, the following are hypothesized:\nH5: Approach temperament moderates the relationship between PJ/PO fit and job performance, such that the positive relationship is stronger for individuals high in approach temperament.\nH6: Approach temperament moderation will be more influential on PJ fit to job performance relationship.\nResearch to Practice Gap\nThere certainly exists a palpable gap between research and practice on the topic of fit-outcome moderators. On the research side, there has only been minimal research on fit-outcome moderators. Additionally, the identified moderators follow theory and are not aimed at solving real-world issues (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005). While the situational moderators researched suggest that change is possible to increase fit-outcome results, the same is not said about personal moderators. The research suggests that there is little an organization can do to mitigate negative influence on fit outcomes when the moderating characteristic is a personal trait.\nMeanwhile, on the practice side, there is a much more active approach to addressing fit-outcome relationships and moderators. First, according to Collings & Mallahi’s (2009) review of strategic talent management, talent management facilitates the filling of key positions within the organization with competent employees and ensures their continued success in organizations. This suggests that talent management is constantly addressing these moderators of fit-outcome relationships. In this case, practice may have additional insight into the relationship that academics have yet to address. Second, as noted in Michaels and colleagues’ (2001) War For Talent, talent management professionals should manage “C players” out of organizations. This is an issue because there may be unaddressed situational moderators that are influencing the job performance of employees. This is a key reason I chose to study role overload and passive leadership as they are characteristics often out of the control of employees.\nTo close the research to practice gap on this issue I propose two steps. First, practice must inform research as to talent management successes for managing moderators, both positive and negative. For example, if an employee that fits well with an organization had stellar job performance prior to working with a passive leader this is evidence that this has a clear impact on the fit-outcome relationship. In this case practice should inform research on additional moderators to study. Second, research must inform practice as to what moderators should be addressed prior to “managing” employees out of organizations. Organizations should look to situational moderators that may be reducing job performance in an employee that initially fit well with their job and organization. There was most likely a concrete reason why this employee was hired. Perhaps now they are experiencing role overload, and this is negative affecting their needs-supplies fit with their job or organization.\n\nStudy Proposal\nMy proposed study will effectively assess the previously stated hypotheses. I will partner with a consulting firm in New York City to gain access to employee data. Once the consulting firm has begun work with a large organization, I will gain permission from said organization to implement a survey assessing fit-outcome moderators. I will aim to recruit a study pool of 200 entry-level employees to ensure proper power for my statistical analyses. Figure 1 is the proposed model of my study.\nMeasures\nAll measures use a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).\nPerceived PO fit: Perceived PO fit is assessed using a 5-item scale from Resick and colleagues (2007).\nPerceived PJ fit: Perceived PJ fit is assessed using a 4-item scale from Caldwell and O’Reilly (1990).\nRole overload: Role overload is assessed using a 3-item scale from Spector and Jex (1998).\nPassive leadership: Passive leadership is assessed using a 10-item scale from Karakitapoğlu-Aygün and Gumusluoglu (2013).\nApproach temperament: Approach temperament is measured with the Behavioral Activation System 13-item scale from Elliot and Thrash (2002).\nJob performance: Job performance will be rated by supervisors of employees.\nData analysis will be conducted with PROCESS v3.4 on SPSS by Andrew Hayes using Model 3.\nConclusion\nIn summary, moderators of the PJ/PO fit-outcome relationship remain understudied in research and perhaps overlooked in practice. We must focus our research on moderators that can be actively applied to talent management to gain positive outcomes for employees and organizations. The current literature remains meager and haphazard. Perhaps the best way to direct research is to learn what has been working on the practice side. Talent management systems are constantly being implemented with success. Therefore, practice may have tentative solutions to the fit-outcome relationship.\nOn the other hand, practice may sometimes overlook situational moderators that may be contributing to negative outcomes for employees. Instead of punishing employees that are underperforming talent management professionals should first look to the literature as to potential moderating characteristics of these relationships. I have proposed a study that I hope can identify more important moderators of the PJ/PO fit-outcome relationship. Further increasing our knowledge on what moderators influence this relationship can steer research and aid practice.\nReferences\nBarling, J., & Frone, M. R. (2017).

    "title": "Video Interviewing: A Best Practices Discussion",
    "description": "There is a rich body of literature in I-O Psychology that helps outline best practices when creating selection measures in organizations (e.g., Campion et al., 1997; Huffcutt & Arthur, 1994; Morgeson & Campion, 1997; Sackett & Lievens, 2008). Some of these best practices include structured and standardized approaches in the way questions are asked and scored. These guidelines are, to some degree, easier to follow when interviews occur in person because the environment can be heavily controlled by the organization. However, in the current climate, more organizations are opting in to utilizing video interviews which should not be regarded as comparable to in person interviews. The current panel discussion addressed the research and practice gap that exists with more novel methods. This panel was discussed at the 2021 SIOP conference.",

    "contents": "\n\nRecently, technology has advanced the ways in which organizations can conduct selection interviews. A 2015 survey performed by Futurestep, a Korn Ferry company, found that 71% of the seven-hundred executives they surveyed use video-interviewing at their organization (Futurestep, 2015). Given the increase in technology-integrated workplaces over the past decade and the rapid move to remotely delivered selection processes due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we can likely assume that these numbers have greatly increased. There are a number of video interview benefits that have fueled this increased adoption, such as the reduced costs in the form of travel expenses and time it takes to individually interview applicants, increased flexibility for both applicants and organizations, expanded applicant pools, increased efficiency, and interview standardization (Blacksmith et al., 2016; Brenner et al., 2016; Langer et al., 2017). With over 100 online vendors offering access to their video interview solutions (Software Advice, 2020) organizations are faced with the decision to conduct either two-way or one-way video interviews.\nThe difference between one-way and two-way interviews exists in the synchronicity of the interview experience. Two-way video interviews, also known as synchronous video interviews, are a form of communication in which applicants and evaluators communicate via a video conference (Straus et al., 2001). Applicants and evaluators see and hear one another in real-time through a videoconference platform (Langer et al., 2017). One-way interviews, also known as asynchronous video interviews, allow applicants to record their answers to interview questions and submit them via an online platform (Gorman et al., 2018). A one-way video interview process typically involves a web link that is sent to prospective applicants inviting them to an online platform to complete the interview (Torres & Gregory, 2018). Once the invitation is accepted, applicants are prompted to record their responses to predetermined interview questions on camera and submit those responses via the online platform (Brenner et al., 2016). The recorded responses are reviewed later at the convenience of an evaluator, be that a hiring manager, recruiter, or artificial intelligence (Woods et al., 2019). Although interchangeable as current methods of applicant interviews between organizations, there are remarkable differences between two-way and one-way interviews that can influence both the candidates’ experience and the usefulness of the interview.\nEstablishing Best Practices\nFirst, several differences between in-person and video interviews need to be addressed when considering best practices for video interview procedures. The two most critical factors to consider when making the comparisons among existing methods are fairness and information. Fairness considerations include: (a) determining whether interviewees are each getting the same amount of time to answer questions, or whether time accommodations are given to specific people that need extra time, (b) whether interviews are viewed in their entirety by evaluators, and (c) how scoring is conducted (e.g., human or AI). In contrast, information considerations focus on how information is lost and gained, and include: (a) what do we learn about an applicant, or organization, when we come face-to-face with them versus when we see them on video, (b) what information is gained from an applicant conducting a video interview from their home environment, and (c) what information is lost by restricting interview communication to video or recorded responses? Below, we briefly review video interviews in comparison to face-to-face interviews as well as provide a comparison of both video interview formats on these dimensions.\nVideo Interviews vs. Face-to-Face\nTraditionally, interviews are thought of as a face-to-face interaction between an interviewer and interviewee (Campion et al., 1997). Thus, it is valuable to discuss fairness and available information during video interviews as they compare to face-to-face interviews because face-to-face interviews are used as an anchor. When we compare fairness between these types of interviews, it is important to consider the extent to which they adhere to the 15 core components of good structured interviews (Campion et al., 1997), which include: (1) time spent interviewing, (2) time spent scoring, (3) types of scoring procedures and how they may differ, and (4) differences in impression management potential. In addition, from an information perspective, we can think about what is lost and gained in both settings. It is important to note that the information that is gained in a video interview setting may be non-KSAO related (e.g., posters on an interviewee’s wall; dogs barking in background), which links obtaining information directly to considerations around fairness. Ultimately, the information lost in video interviews may be in the form of lower media richness in video interviews (e.g., non-verbal behaviors, eye-contact). However, increased structure in video interviews may lead to greater job relevant information gained from the interview experience.\nOne-Way vs. Two-Way Video Interviews\nUsing this same fairness-information framework, we can compare one-way and two-way video interviews. From a fairness perspective, we can consider: (1) time allotted for interviewing/answering questions, (2) time spent reviewing and scoring (3) applicant reactions to both mediums, (4) influences on organizational attraction, (5) influences on evaluator ratings, and (6) applicant performance between mediums. From an information perspective, we can consider: (1) information gained from follow-up questions and interactivity in two-way interviews, (2) information lost from a lack of interpersonal communication available in one-way interviews, and (3) information gained in the form of increased structure one-way interviews.\nBoth of the dimensions discussed are critical to consider from applicant and evaluator perspectives. Thoughtfully considering the dimensions when creating selection assessments from both of these lenses can lead to a more well-rounded approach to organizational decision making in their selection process. The chair and co-chairs of the session have carefully collected the panelists to discuss some of these issues.\nChair/Co-Chair Biographies\nDr. Charles A.

    "title": "Do Something! Passive Leadership as a Predictor of Turnover Intention via Job Insecurity",
    "description": "Passive leadership has been recently established as a potential reason for increased workplace stressors. Considering passive leadership as a root cause of stressors in the workplace, the current study examined job insecurity as a mediator of the relationship between passive leadership and turnover intention. Additionally, we tested if affective commitment could reduce the negative effect of job insecurity on turnover intention. Our findings suggest passive leadership positively predicted job insecurity that in turn positively predicted the intention to leave the organization. However, affective commitment did not buffer the effect of job insecurity on turnover intention. Findings of the current study contributes to a better understanding of potential antecedents of job insecurity. This study was presented at the 2021 SIOP conference.",

    "contents": "\n\nDestructive leadership is a prevalent issue in the workplace with passive leadership being the most common (Aasland et al., 2010). Passive leadership is categorized by the disengagement and volitional inaction of a leader (DeRue et al., 2011). These leaders relinquish the responsibility of their position, provide no feedback, delay decision making, and fail to help followers satisfy their needs (Northouse, 2010). Further, passive leaders ignore problems in the workplace and neglect to clarify behavioral expectations of their employees (Harold & Holtz, 2015). At the basic level, it is a failure to carry out the functions of leadership (Barling & Frone, 2017). Even with a high frequency, passive leadership remains understudied compared to other forms of destructive leadership behaviors such as abusive supervision or unethical leadership behavior (Aasland et al., 2010; Barling & Frone, 2017).\nBased on the root cause framework of poor leadership (Kelloway et al., 2005) that passive leadership can be a root cause of additional stressors, multiple studies have established that passive leadership positively predicts workplace stressors such as role ambiguity, role conflict, and role overload among subordinates (e.g., Barling & Frone, 2017; Skogsted et al., 2014). Additionally, high levels of conflict and incivility were found among subordinates with passive leaders (Harold & Holtz, 2015; Skogsted et al., 2007). Following this line of research, the current study aims to examine whether passive leadership might be related to increased job insecurity. Establishing passive leadership as a potential predictor of job insecurity is of paramount importance for two main reasons. First, there is a lack of understanding of antecedents of job insecurity (Jiang & Lavaysse, 2018). Establishing passive leadership as a predictor of job insecurity will extend the literature on antecedents of job insecurity. Second, due to the negative impact of job insecurity on employee well-being, performance, and job attitudes (Shoss, 2017), identifying passive leadership as a potential antecedent can help organizations develop strategies to reduce job insecurity. Implementing strategies to reduce job insecurity may also reduce subsequent outcomes such as turnover intention (Staufenbiel & König, 2010).\nThe current study also examines the indirect effect of passive leadership on turnover intentions via job insecurity. Turnover intention has and should continue to receive much attention in the literature because of its positive association with actual voluntary turnover (Lambert et al., 2001), as well as the financial and performance-related costs of employee voluntary turnover (Lee & Mitchell, 1994). Job insecurity has been established as an important predictor of turnover intention because the uncertainty of future job security is a stressful experience that may result in employees intending to leave the organization (Shoss, 2017). Based on the root cause framework of poor leadership (Kelloway et al., 2005), it is likely that passive leadership can indirectly predict increased turnover intentions via job insecurity, and the current study will empirically test this relationship.\nWe also explore affective commitment as a potential moderator of the relationship between job insecurity and turnover intention. Employees affectively committed to an organization wish to remain at that organization because there exists a congruency of values and goals (Meyer & Allen, 1991). When employees work towards the success of the organization, they will behave in a manner that is consistent with their own values and therefore derive benefits from this work (Meyer & Allen, 1991). Affective commitment has previously been shown to reduce the negative impact of stressors on employee performance, and it was suggested that employees high in affective commitment are likely to direct their efforts towards important work tasks and reduce resources towards extraneous activities (Hunter & Thatcher, 2007; Podsakoff et al., 2007). Extending this logic, employees high in affective commitment experiencing job insecurity may devote their efforts towards their current job role rather than ruminating or worrying about job insecurity and should have lower levels of turnover intention as a result of job insecurity.\nPassive Leadership and Theoretical Framework\nPassive leadership is common in organizations with up to 20% of employees reporting frequent exposure to passive leadership behaviors (Aasland et al., 2010). This type of leadership is categorized within the full-range leadership theory spectrum as encompassing both inactive and ineffective behaviors (Bass, 1998). Passive leadership inactivity is mainly due to the leaders’ failure to initiate structure or define role tasks for their subordinates (DeRue et al., 2011). In addition, passive leaders are generally ineffective because when problems do not exist or are not directly apparent to the leader they do not engage with their employees (Bass, 1998).\nThe root cause of poor leadership framework suggests that poor leadership is a “root cause” that gives rise to other well-documented workplace stressors (Kelloway et al., 2005). Passive leadership along with abusive supervision are the two main leadership categories that have been shown to result in the proliferation of other stressors. The inability for a leader to effectively and actively engage with and provide direction for their employees leads to other stressors and subsequent unfavorable outcomes. Previous studies have found that passive leadership was positively related to workplace stressors such as role overload (Barling & Frone, 2017), role ambiguity (Skogstad et al., 2014), experienced workplace incivility (Harold & Holtz, 2015), and work-family conflict (Che et al., 2017). Additionally, subsequent unfavorable outcomes have been found to be increased burnout and negative physical symptoms (Che et al., 2017), increased behavioral incivility among subordinates (Harold & Holtz, 2015), decreased employee justice perceptions (Holtz & Hu, 2017), and increased psychological distress (Skogsted et al., 2007).\nPassive Leadership, Job Insecurity, and Turnover Intention\nJob insecurity is defined as concerns about the permanence of one’s job position and has been described as a perceived powerlessness to act upon the possibility of job loss (Glambek et al., 2014). The construct of job insecurity lies on a continuum ranging from secure to insecure feelings about the stability of one’s job position (Shoss, 2017). Jiang and Lavaysse’s (2018) meta-analysis indicated that significant correlates of job insecurity include poor supervisor support, poor trust in management, and low levels of interpersonal justice.\nPassive leaders neglect to support and fail to direct their employees (DeRue et al., 2011), and passive leadership can reflect a lack of support for their employees (Kelloway et al., 2005). Because the lack of supervisor support is an important predictor of job insecurity (Jiang & Lavaysse, 2018), it is likely that passive leadership will positively predict job insecurity. Specifically, job insecurity can be caused by feelings of unpredictability and uncontrollability (Jiang & Lavaysee, 2018). Passive leaders do not engage in traditional leadership behaviors and leave employees unable to predict their leaders’ behaviors (DeRue et al., 2011). The reduced supervisor social support from passive leaders can also increase the unpredictability and uncontrollability of an employee’s work experience. Based on these theoretical connections, the following hypothesis is proposed:\nH1: Passive leadership will have a positive relationship with job insecurity.\nTurnover intention is the cognitive withdrawal process employees make that prefaces the final decision to leave an organization (Kim et al., 2017). Job insecurity threatens the loss of important financial and social resources. Rather than continuing to deal with the possible loss of these resources, employees may develop the cognitive withdrawal thoughts to leave the organization in search of more secure sources to fulfill their resource needs (Sverke et al., 2002). Supporting this notion, job insecurity has previously been shown to predict turnover intention (Jiang & Lavaysse, 2018; Staufenbiel & König, 2010; Sverke et al., 2002).\nBased on the above proposal that passive leadership can positively predict job insecurity, as well as the established relationship between job insecurity and turnover intentions, it is likely that job insecurity can play a mediating role between passive leadership and turnover intentions. This is consistent with the root cause of poor leadership framework (Kelloway et al., 2005) that passive leadership may lead to distal strain outcomes through increased stressors. Thus, the following hypothesis is proposed:\nH2: Job insecurity will mediate the relationship between passive leadership and turnover intentions.\nModerating Effect of Affective Commitment\nAffective commitment is a subset of the broader concept of organizational commitment (Meyer & Allen, 1991). Affective commitment is defined as an employee’s emotional attachment to an organization characterized by acceptance of organizational values, identification with the organization, and willingness to remain at the organization (Mowday, Steers & Porter, 1982). Employees with high affective commitment work at the organization because they want to (Meyer & Allen, 1991). Common outcomes of affective commitment include intent to remain at the organization, increased job satisfaction, and decreased turnover (Clegg, 1983; Collareli et al., 1987; Somers, 1995).\nWe suggest that affective commitment will have a buffering effect on the relationship between job insecurity and turnover intention. Following the attention theory of stress, individuals with higher levels of affective commitment toward their organization tend to channel stress into positive work outcomes (Hunter & Thatcher, 2007). Employees high in affective commitment actively accept the values and goals of their organization and put effort towards accomplishing these goals (Mayer & Schoorman, 1992). Workers who are highly committed are more likely, when under stress, to direct their efforts towards important work tasks and to reduce resources devoted to other activities (Hunter & Thatcher, 2007).\nEmployees high in affective commitment experiencing job insecurity are likely to channel the stress into actively accomplishing work tasks and organizational goals, reducing distal strains. In contrast, employees low in affective commitment are more susceptible to distal strain from stressors (Podsakoff et al., 2007) and are unlikely to channel stress into positive work outcomes (Hunter & Thatcher, 2007). Without the ability to focus their attention on positive work outcomes under stress, these employees are likely to perceive the stress from job insecurity more negatively. Resources will not be directed towards important tasks but rather towards non-work-related activities such as intending to leave the organization. Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed:\nH3: Affective commitment moderates the relationship between job insecurity and turnover intention, such that the positive relationship is weaker for individuals high in affective commitment.\nFigure 1 summarizes the proposed relationships.\n\nMethod\nWe recruited our participants from Amazon.com’s Mechanical Turk. Data was collected in two waves with one month in between to reduce common method variance (Podsakoff et al., 2003). At time 1 (T1), we distributed our survey to Mechanical Turk full-time employees in North America who worked at least 30 hours per week. A total of 425 participants took the initial survey. One hundred and eighty-three participants were excluded from the final data set for the following reasons: 23 indicated that they were not in North America or failed to respond to that question, 12 did not answer any survey question, 69 failed to pass the attention check questions, 13 people’s IP addresses were not from North America, 16 did not complete the majority of the survey questions, 5 reported working fewer than 30 hours per week, and 45 indicated they would not participate in the follow-up survey. The remaining sample included 242 full-time employees at T1.\nAt time 2 (T2), the survey was sent to the 242 participants at T1 and 217 started the survey. Twenty-three of these participants were omitted due to not answering any survey question or failing to pass the attention check questions. We conducted our analyses with those who had both T1 and T2 data. In this final sample of 168 participants, 58% were male, 81.5% were white, working in a variety of industries (e.g., service (20.8%), finance (12.5%), education (11.3%), and manufacturing (10.7%). Their average age was 39.1 years (SD = 10.9 years) and their average tenure was 7.7 years (SD = 6.1 years).\nPassive leadership, job insecurity, and participants’ demographics were measured at T1. Turnover intention and affective commitment were measured at T2. All measures used a 7-point Likert scale with response options ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).\nPassive Leadership. Passive leadership was assessed using a 10-item scale from Karakitapoğlu-Aygün and Gumusluoglu (2013). Participants were asked to rate the extent to which each item described their supervisors. An example item was “Avoids responsibility” (alpha = .97).\nJob Insecurity. Job insecurity was assessed using 10-item scale from Oldham and colleagues (1988). An example item was “I am secure in my job” (alpha = .94).\nAffective Commitment. Affective commitment was assessed using a 6-item scale from Meyer and colleagues (1993). An example item was “I would be very happy to spend the rest of my career with this organization” (alpha = .95).\nTurnover Intention. Turnover intention was assessed using a 3-item scale from Cammann and colleagues (1979). An example item was “I often think of quitting” (alpha = .96).\nDemographics. Demographic information was collected at Time 1, including gender, age, years of job tenure, and hours worked per week.\nResults\nTable 1 shows means, standard deviations, and correlations among studied variables. To test Hypothesis 1 a simple linear regression was run. As predicted, passive leadership positively predicted job insecurity, b= .37, p < .001. Thus, Hypothesis 1 was supported.\n\nHypothesis 2 was tested using PROCESS v3.4 on SPSS (Hayes, 2012). Model 4 was used to test the mediation relationship. As shown in Figure 2, passive leadership significantly predicted job insecurity, b = .37, p < .001 and job insecurity significantly predicted turnover intention, b = .38, p < .05. The indirect effect of passive leadership on turnover intention was .14 with a bootstrapped 95% CI [.04, .25]. Thus, Hypothesis 2 was supported.\nTo test Hypothesis 3, PROCESS model 1 for moderation was used. Affective commitment did not significantly moderate the relationship between job insecurity and turnover intention because the interaction between job insecurity and affective commitment in predicting turnover intention was not significant, b= .05, p= .18. Thus, Hypothesis 3 was not supported.\n\nDiscussion\nThe present study finds that job insecurity mediates the relationship between passive leadership and turnover intention. Affective commitment was not found to moderate the relationship between job insecurity and turnover intention. Despite the unsupported moderation hypothesis, we believe our findings can contribute to the literature in two main ways.\nFirst, building on the root cause of poor leadership framework (Kelloway et al., 2005), we establish passive leadership as a potential cause of job insecurity. That is, when employees experience passive leadership, they are likely to develop job insecurity due to the lack of support, predictability, or controllability coming from their leader. This finding is consistent with previous literature that passive leadership is positively related to various other workplace stressors (Barling & Frone, 2017; Che et al., 2017; Harold & Holtz, 2015; Skogstad et al., 2014).\nSecond, we demonstrate the mediating role of job insecurity in the relationship between passive leadership and turnover intention. The experienced job insecurity subordinates develop from passive leadership may lead employees to develop intentions to leave the organization. This finding is consistent with previous findings that passive leadership may lead to distal strain through increased stressors (Che et al., 2017). Both of our contributions provide additional empirical support for the root cause of poor leadership framework (Kelloway et al., 2005).\nWe did not find support for the buffering role of affective commitment on the effect of job insecurity on turnover intention. This finding is not consistent with previous literature that affective commitment buffers the effects of stressors on strain outcomes (Podsakoff et al., 2007). One potential reason is that affective commitment is unable to buffer potential resource losses by job insecurity and individuals will inevitably begin the cognitive withdrawal process from the organization in search of a more stable supply of resources.\nOn the practice side, our findings suggest it may be beneficial to look to leadership behaviors in an organization if there is an increase in job insecurity perception or turnover intentions. Decreasing passive leadership behaviors and encouraging supervisor support for subordinates could result in decreased apprehension among employees about the security of their job position. Instead of cognitively withdrawing from the organization, employees may be more motivated to continue their membership in their organizations.\n## Limitations and directions for future research\nAlthough we used a time-lagged design, this study used self-report measures and the potential for common-method variance exists (Podsakoff et al., 2003). Second, the sample used in this study was predominantly white males, which might influence the results since minorities and protected class groups have reported more passive aggressive behavior from leadership (Hughes & Brown, 2018). Third, there may be other potential moderators and mediators that influence these relationships such as type of industry and organization (e.g., a large number of participants worked in the service industry), position held by the employee, tenure at the organization, and more.\nAdditionally, this study offers insight into future directions of research. First, due to data collection at two different time points, we cannot draw conclusions regarding the direction of these relationships. Future studies using similar designs to study passive leadership are needed to examine the direction of effects observed in the current study by measuring all variables across four measurement time points and conducting cross-lagged mediation analyses. Second, given a sharp increase in job insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic (Wilson et al., 2020), future research is needed to examine these relationships in new workplace environments. Longitudinal studies tracking job insecurity, its antecedents, and outcomes during the pandemic would offer key insights into other variables that affect this relationship.\nReferences\nAasland, M.

    "description": "While the relationship between workplace incivility and work-to-family conflict has been established by a few studies, the underlying mechanisms remain understudied. The current study adopted a cognitive approach by examining negative rumination at work and after work as mediators of the relationship between workplace incivility and work-to-family conflict and by testing the buffering effect of trait mindfulness. Our findings suggest those who experience more incivility at work from supervisors and coworkers are more likely to ruminate these negative events at work and after work, and thus experience more work-to-family conflict; further, trait mindfulness can potentially reduce the spillover process of negative rumination from at work to after work. This study was presented at the SIOP 2020 conference.",

    "contents": "\n\nWorkplace incivility is prevalent issue in the workplace (Porath & Pearson, 2013), and research over the past 15 years has shown that it can affect various employee health-related, work-related, and nonwork domain outcomes (Cortina, Kabat-Farr, Magley, & Nelson, 2017). Among the nonwork domain outcomes, work-to-family conflict has been relatively less studied despite its important implications for employees and organizations alike (Amstad, Meier, Fasel, Elfering, & Semmer, 2011). While a recent study (Zhou, Meier, & Spector, 2019) established that emotional exhaustion mediated the relationship between workplace incivility and work-to-family conflict, the present study aims to expand the research on this relationship by examining additional underlying mechanisms.\nThis work contributes to the incivility literature in two ways. First, we examine negative ruminations at work and after work in addition to emotional exhaustion as mediators between workplace incivility and work-to-family conflict. Based on a resource-based perspective, Zhou et al. (2019) established emotional exhaustion as a mediator in this relationship. Building on their work and controlling for emotional exhaustion, the current study attempts to understand how incivility might be linked to work-to-family conflict through a cognitive perspective. Exploring negative rumination as a mediator will help us better understand other mediating mechanisms and their influence on the outcomes of incivility.\nSecond, we investigate the moderating role of trait mindfulness. Mindfulness, although understudied, in the workplace has been linked to positive outcomes for employees’ wellbeing (Roche, Haar, & Luthans, 2014). According to the limited research, mindfulness does have the ability to buffer the negative affects employees may experience when they encounter negative experiences at work (e.g., Long and Christian, 2015). Employees with higher levels of trait mindfulness focus on the present and disengage themselves from negative experiences (Shapiro, Carslon, Aston, & Freedman, 2006). We predict that trait mindfulness will buffer the effects of workplace incivility on negative rumination and the effect of negative rumination at work on after work. Examining trait mindfulness can help us understand potential boundary conditions of how workplace incivility effects unfold to the nonwork domain.\nWorkplace Incivility and Work-to-Family Conflict\nWorkplace incivility is defined as “low-intensity deviant behavior with ambiguous intent to harm the target, in violation of workplace norms for mutual respect” (Andersson & Pearson, 1999, p. 457). Porath and Pearson (2013) reported that research from the past 14 years, 98% of participants reported being victims of workplace incivility, which demonstrates that it is a pervasive issue. In the current study, we focused on workplace incivility from coworkers and supervisors. Coworker incivility occurs when the target experiences the set of low-intensity deviant behaviors that are carried out by one’s coworkers (Sliter, Sliter, & Jex, 2012). Supervisor incivility refers to employees experiencing low-deviant behaviors from their supervisors. Individuals in higher supervisory roles have been found to be responsible for about 60% of all reported workplace incivility incidents cases (Pearson & Porath, 2009).\nWork-to-family conflict is defined as the incompatibility between the demands of work and family (Amstad et al., 2011). Job demands can deplete the resources that can be dedicated to family. It is important to understand work-to-family conflict due to its prevalence and negative impact on employee wellbeing (Geurts, Kompier, Roxburgh, & Houtman, 2003). Michel, Kotrba, Deuling, and Clark’s (2011) meta-analysis indicated that common antecedents of work-family conflict include work role stressors, work role involvement, work social support, work characteristics, and personality.\nWorkplace Incivility, Negative Rumination, and Work-to-Family Conflict\nWorkplace incivility has been linked to work-to-family conflict in previous research (Lim & Lee, 2011), suggesting that targets of workplace incivility are more likely to experience work-to-family conflict. Research has additionally established that emotional exhaustion, an indicator of depletion of resources, can serve as a mediator in this relationship (Zhou et al., 2019). The current study hopes to strengthen our understanding by exploring negative rumination at work and after work as mediators.\nRumination can be defined as having repetitive thoughts by a certain occurrence (Martin & Tesser, 1996). Negative rumination at work can be viewed as the inability to detach from work-related thoughts stemming from a negative experience (Cropley, Michalianou, Pravettoni, & Millward, 2012). It reflects an individual’s inability to “cognitively switch off” about work related issues after work (Cropley & Purvis, 2003). Victims of workplace incivility are likely to be left wondering what their place is in their organization, leading to a long period of reflection afterward (Pearson, Andersson, and Porath, 2000). Targets are more likely to ruminate about this negative experience at work. Shapiro (2013) discovered that workplace incivility positively predicted stress-reactive rumination and Demsky, Fritz, Hammer, and Black (2019) also found that experiencing workplace incivility was linked with increased negative work rumination. Based on these findings, we propose the following:\nH1: Supervisor incivility (a) and coworker incivility (b) will have a positive relationship with negative rumination at work.\nTremmel and Sonnentag (2018) found that the effects of workplace incivility might spill over their nonwork domain, such that incivility positively predicted negative affect after, at bedtime, and the next morning. We believe workplace incivility might also have similar effects on negative ruminations. Negative rumination is intrusive and tends to lead to decreased motivation and depression (Lyubomirsky & Tkach, 2003). Demsky, Ellis, and Fritz (2014) found that targets of workplace incivility are less likely to disengage from work in nonwork hours. They are likely to continue the repeated negative thoughts after work, and have a difficult time “letting go.” Thus, we propose the following hypothesis:\nH2: Negative rumination at work will mediate the relationships of supervisor incivility (a) and coworker incivility (b) and negative rumination after work.\nHaggard, Robert, and Rose (2011) discovered that rumination at work and discussing negative workplace events was linked to work-family conflict. We believe this same effect can be observed between negative rumination after work and work-to-family conflict. When employees continue to have repeated negative thoughts about work-related events after work, their energy is consumed, interfering with family involvement. Edwards and Rothbard (2000) found that when employees leave work in a negative affective state, their social interactions at home are impaired. Negative rumination also has been found to have an impact on sleeping patterns and a positive relationship with insomnia (Demsky et al., 2019). Given that sleep quality is critical for better work-life balance (Allen & Kiburz, 2011), it is likely that insomnia caused by rumination can result in work-family conflict. Controlling for the mediating role of emotional exhaustion between workplace incivility and work-family conflict (Zhou et al., 2019), we propose the following:\nH3: Supervisor incivility (a) and coworker incivility (b) will have indirect effects on work-to-family conflict through negative rumination at work and negative rumination after work.\nModerating Effect of Trait Mindfulness\nGlomb, Duffy, Bono, and Yang (2011) defined trait mindfulness as the dispositional individual differences of being attentive and aware of the present. Brown and Ryan (2003) found that individuals with higher levels of trait mindfulness are more likely to regulate their actions and reactions in a way that will help them fulfill their need for control. Those with high levels of trait mindfulness may be able to accept upsetting events without having strong emotional reactions to it in order to maintain and regulate their environment.\nWe suggest that trait mindfulness will have a buffering effect on the relationship between workplace incivility and negative rumination at work. Individuals with higher levels of trait mindfulness tend to respond to stress experiences, such as incidents of workplace incivility, in an accepting way and let these negative experiences pass without reaction (Ciesla, Reilly, Dickson, Emanuel, & Updegraff, 2012). Literature has established that mindful individuals are less likely to ruminate and are able to detach (Borders, Earleywine, & Jajodia, 2010). Roche et al. (2014) also discovered that mindful individuals are less likely to personalize events, in that they are likely to be able to remove themselves from negative events mentally. The same rationale can be applied to the relationship between workplace incivility and negative rumination at work, such that trait mindfulness is likely to mitigate this relationship.\nH4: Trait mindfulness will buffer the effects of supervisor incivility (a) and coworker incivility (b) on negative rumination at work, such that the positive effects will be weaker for those with high trait mindfulness.\nResearch on mindfulness also suggests that those with higher trait mindfulness are more likely to create boundaries between work and family life (Tarraf, 2017). Michel, Bosch, and Rexroth (2014) and Allen and Kiburz (2011) found that individuals that have an ability to detach from work-related thoughts have a better work-life balance. Thus, it is likely that those with high trait mindfulness pay more attention to maintaining the boundary between work and nonwork life. Thus, trait mindfulness can potentially buffer the spillover of negative rumination from work to after work. Thus, we hypothesize the following:\nH5: Trait mindfulness will buffer the relationship between negative rumination at work on negative rumination after work, such that the positive relationship will be weaker for those with high trait mindfulness.\nFigure 1 summarizes the proposed relationships.\n\nMethod\nWe recruited our participants using Qualtrics Panel Services, a third-party online survey administration platform. We collected two waves of data with one month in between to reduce common method variance (Podsakoff, Mackenzie, Lee, & Podsakoff, 2003). At Time 1, Qualtrics distributed our surveys to full-time employees in North America who were at least 18 years old, at their current job for 6 months or more, and worked at least 35 hours per week. A total of 481 participants took the initial survey. One month later, a second survey was only sent to those who participated in the initial survey, and 246 of them responded (response rate = 51%). We conducted our analyses with data from those who had both with both Time 1 and Time 2 data. In this final sample of 246 participants, 51% were female and 47.6% were white, working in a variety of industries (e.g., 12% from service industry, 11% from education industry, 7% from manufacturing, and 7% from finance).\nUnless otherwise specified, all measures were using a 5-point Likert scale with response options ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree).\nWorkplace Incivility. We measured workplace incivility from supervisor and coworker with 7 items each from Cortina et al. (2001) at Time 1. An example item was “My supervisor (coworker) put me down or was condescending to me.” with response options from 1 (Never) to 5 (Always).\nNegative Rumination at Work. We measured negative rumination at work with 4 items from Frone (2015) at Time 1. An example item was “how often do you replay negative work events in your mind while at work” with response options from 1 (Never) to 4 (Often).\nTrait Mindfulness. We measured trait mindfulness at Time 1 with 15 items from Brown and Ryan (2003). A sample item is “I could be experiencing some emotion and not be conscious of it until sometime later” with response options from 1 (Almost never) to 7 (Almost always).\nNegative Rumination after Work. We measured negative rumination after work with 4 items adapted from Frone (2015) at Time 2. An example item was “how often do you replay negative work events in your mind when you are away from work” with response options from 1 (Never) to 4 (Often).\nEmotional Exhaustion. We measured emotional exhaustion with 8 items from Demerouti, Mostert, and Bakker (2010). An example item was “There are days when I feel tired before I arrive at work.” with response options from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 4 (Strongly Agree).\nwith 4 items adapted from Frone (2015) at Time 2. An example item was “how often do you replay negative work events in your mind when you are away from work” with response options from 1 (Never) to 4 (Often).\nWork-family Conflict. We measured work-family conflict with 5 items from Netemeyer, Boles, and McMurrian (1996). An example item was “The demands of my work interfere with my home and family life”.\nDemographics. Demographic information was collected at Time 1, including gender, age, tenure, and hours worked per week.\nResults\nTable 1 shows means, standard deviations, and correlations among studied variables. To test Hypotheses 1 to 3, we ran a path analysis model and Figure 2 shows unstandardized regression coefficients for all paths. We also estimated the indirect effects for all mediation hypotheses. As shown in Figure 2, both supervisor incivility (b= .25, p < .001) and coworker incivility (b= .46, p < .001) positively predicted negative rumination at work, supporting Hypothesis 1a and 1b. Negative rumination at work positively predicted negative rumination after work (b= .44, p < .001); the indirect effect of supervisor incivility on negative rumination after work was .11 with 95% bootstrapped CI [.06, .17], and the indirect effect of coworker incivility on negative rumination after work was .20 with 95% bootstrapped CI [.12, .29]. Thus, Hypotheses 2a and 2b were supported.\n\nNegative rumination after work positively predicted work-to-family conflict (b= .30, p < .001). Further, the indirect effect of supervisor incivility on negative rumination work-to-family conflict through negative ruminations at work and after work was ..03 with 95% bootstrapped CI [.01, .07], and the indirect effect of coworker incivility was .06 with 95% bootstrapped CI [.02, .12]. Thus, Hypotheses 3a and 4b were supported.\nTo tested hypothesis 4 and 5, we added trait mindfulness as a moderator in model 1. The interaction between supervisor incivility and trait mindfulness in predicting negative rumination at work was not significant, b= -.07, p = .33, and the interaction between coworker incivility and trait mindfulness in predicting negative rumination at work was also not significant, b= -.04, p = .65. Thus, Hypotheses 4a and 4b were not supported.\n\nThe interaction between negative rumination at work and trait mindfulness in predicting negative rumination after work was significant, b = -.11, p < .05. Figure 3 shows the plot of this interaction, suggesting that the positive relationship between negative rumination at work and negative rumination after work was weaker for those with higher trait mindfulness. Thus, Hypothesis 5 was supported.\n\nDiscussion\nThe present study finds that negative rumination at work and after work mediate the effect of workplace incivility on work-to-family conflict, while trait mindfulness buffers the relationship of negative rumination at work on negative rumination after work. These findings contribute to the literature in two main ways.\nFirst, building on the resource-based approach of Zhou et al. (2019) and controlling for the mediating role of emotional exhaustion, we demonstrates that workplace incivility can also potentially lead to work-to-family conflict through a cognitive process. That is, when employees are targets of workplace incivility at work, they are not only more likely to ruminate about these events at work, but also have similar thoughts even after they leave work. These repeated negative thoughts can potentially interfere with their ability to fulfill family demands, thus creating more work-to-family conflict. This finding is also consistent with previous finding that negative rumination mediates the relationship between abusive supervision and work-family conflict (Haggard et al., 2011).\nSecond, we for the first time bring trait mindfulness in the spillover process of workplace incivility and found that trait mindfulness moderate the relationship between negative rumination at work and after work, suggesting that trait mindfulness can be a beneficial factor to help employees avoid the spillover of negative thoughts from work to after work. This is consistent with findings that those with higher trait mindfulness tend to have higher level of work-life balance (Allen and Kiburz, 2011). However, we did not find support for the buffering role of trait mindfulness on the effect of workplace incivility and negative rumination at work, which is not consistent with previous findings that trait mindfulness buffers the effects of negative events. This is likely due to the ambiguous nature of workplace incivility, which makes it harder for people not to think about whether the perpetrators are intentional or how they should cope with it.\nOn the practice side, our findings suggest it might be beneficial for organizations to introduce mindfulness training in the organization, as evidenced in Long and Christian (2015). Even if targets of workplace incivility are likely to engage in rumination at work, a mindfulness training program can help employees practice good ways to relax and recover, create boundaries between their work life and family life, and experience less work-to-family conflict.\nAlthough we used a time-lagged design, this study used self-report measures and the potential for common method bias exists (Podaskoff, Mackenzie, Lee, & Podaskoff, 2003). Second, the sample used in this study is predominantly white and female, which might bias the results since females and people of color report experiencing more workplace incivility (Cortina, Magley, Williams, & Langhout, 2001). Third, there may be other potential moderators and mediators that influence this relationship, including the type of industry and organization, the position that the employees hold, and more.\nReferences\nAllen, Tammy & M Kiburz, Kaitlin.
